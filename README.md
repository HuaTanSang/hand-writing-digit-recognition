# Hand writing digit recognition  
In this repository, I'm going to build some Deep Learning model with pytorch for hand writing digit recognition task.  
This repo contains:  
- Multi-layer Perceptron  
- LeNet  
- GoogLeNet  
- ResNet18  
- Others model will be updated soon.  

# Dataset  
This repository focus on mnist dataset.  
Download URL:  https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/  

# Requirement  
Required library is listed in `requirement.txt`.  
However, for `torch` in `NVIDIA` hardware. You need to type `nvidia-smi` in your terminal first to find your `CUDA` version.  
Then, browse to `pytorch.org` and find download scripts of version that lower than yours.  
Paste the scripts to terminal to install `torch`.  

# Demo on Streamlit
